# Dynamic-web-scraping
Web scraping a dynamic webiste with infinite scrolling 

Here I have used Selenium, Beautiful soup and Pandas to extract the data of the prices of diffrent Etherium Network Servers and convert that data into a Excel file , which can be used for further analysis.

There is a custom counter through which you can  decide the amount of scrolls for which the data is to be extracted.
