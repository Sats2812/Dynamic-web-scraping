Here I have used Selenium, Beautiful soup and Pandas to extract the data of the prices of diffrent Etherium Name Services and convert that data into a Excel file , which can be used for further analysis.


  Note: You need to have a chromedriver and all the packages mentioned above pre-installed on your computer for running the file
